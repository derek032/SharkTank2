	<p>
	Our team is <strong>Community Service Scholars or "CSS"</strong> for a shorter version. Our group consists of 4 members Derek Lee, Lewis Pimiento, Omar Ahmed, and Biraj Dutta.<strong>The leader and CEO behind the company is Derek Lee</strong>. Derek Lee is responsible for making sure that all the members contribute into our clients needs respectfully and came up with our products needs as well as typing the content and some coding. <strong>Lewis Pimiento is the second in command</strong>. He is responsible for a little bit of everything, including but limited to coding, images, design, etc. <strong>Omar Ahmed is the chief in product design and images</strong>. He is responsible for creating the client's products, the banner, and the logo. <strong>Lastly, Biraj Dutta is the chief in coding and responsible for most of the coding</strong>. He creates the code, checks if the code works and if the page looks fine, he also designed some of the product images. But as a group of 4 we make up the team "CSS" and our needs from the people who wanted our ideas are as follows. <br>
<!-- EVERYTHING BELOW SHOULD BE IN A LIST!!! -->		
-A web page that advertises our product that reveals our needs. <br>
-Clean and sleek design that appeals to all the ages groups. <br>
-An app that is easy to use and navigate.<br>
-Colors that don't distract from the overall message of the idea and content.<br>
